Hello, Everyone! Welcome to my Git Repository. 

Here, I have uploaded a program from my computer science class, CS1300 @ CU Boulder.
The program displays a wire-frame space shuttle. To run the program, you must download the shuttle.dat file. 
'Shuttle.dat' supplies all the vertices for the wire-frame, provided by my instructor, Prof. Michael Main. 

My first and only computer science class was CS1300. It grounded my understanding of C++. 
I am self-taught in all of my other programing languages.

Thanks for stopping by!
